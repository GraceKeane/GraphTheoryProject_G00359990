## Introduction
For this assignment I created a Python programe that can build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression. It then can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any hardcoded or prompted string of text. 

<b>Regular Expression (regex)</b><br>
The concept of regular expressions arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene formalized the description of a regular language. A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp, also referred to as rational expression) is a string containing a series of characters, some of which have a special meaning. They are commonly used in search engines and many programming languages provide regex capabilities either built-in or via libraries. Essentially regular expressions are used is a search pattern used for matching one or more characters within a string that is why regex is perfect for the implementation of this Graph Theory project.
