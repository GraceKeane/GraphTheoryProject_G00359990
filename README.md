Thompsons construction is a method of transforming a regular expression into an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA). NFAs can be used to match strings against the regular expression. NFA is short for non-deterministic finite automaton, It was designed and implemented by Michael O. Rabin and Dana Scott. NFA’s are designed to only recognise regular languages.

A regular expression is a string containing a series of characters that have special meaning. For example, the three characters |, .  and * have the special meanings concatenate, or, and Kleene star. For example, the regular expression 0.1 means a 0 followed by a 1, 0|1 means a 0 or a 1, and 1* means any number of 1’s. 

Python has well-defined rules for specifying the order in which the operators in an expression are evaluated when the expression has several operators. For example, multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Precedence rules can be overridden by explicit parentheses.

The Thompsons construction algorithm works by splitting an expression into its constituent subexpressions. This algorithm is created by a computer scientist called Kem Thompson.
