Thompsons construction is a method of transforming a regular expression into an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA). NFAs can be used to match strings against the regular expression. The algorithm works by splitting an expression into its constituent subexpressions. This algorithm is created by a computer scientist called Kem Thompson.
